My personal projects with PowerShell to learning...

If you find anything to help you, it's great.

The project file called apiloc.ps1, is an example with API Location with the domain sites.

The project file called jogo_galo.ps1, is a Tic Tac Toe game make in Powershell, is playable but needs some improves when i'm learning.
